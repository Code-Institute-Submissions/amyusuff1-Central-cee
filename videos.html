        The fact that “Doja” feels more tactical than exploitative is what (just about) saves the song from crashing into offensive territory. He’s had previous success with samples, a trend that unites the mainstream U.K. rap scene he hails from with Brooklyn drill, having jumped on PinkPantheress’ “Just For Me” last year. The transatlantic aspirations of “Doja” extend further, not just in his lyrical flirtation with Doja Cat but also the fact that tastemaker director Cole Bennett shot the video, his first time working with a U.K. artist.

It’s not all meme-worthy words and industry goals, though. Elsewhere, the U.K. rapper delves into the homoerotic undertones of gang culture, though he sadly pulls back rather than delving further with his observations. Central Cee is a rapper in uber-confident mode right now, surfing the wave of his mixtape 23 and looking to build bridges overseas. “Doja” seems like it has achieved its express goal of grabbing as many eyeballs as possible. What he does with this moment in the spotlight will be interesting to watch.
